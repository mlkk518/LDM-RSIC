## Abstract
> Learning-based image compression algorithms typically focus on designing encoding and decoding networks and improving the accuracy of entropy model estimation to enhance the rate-distortion (RD) performance. However, few algorithms leverage the compression distortion prior from existing compression algorithms to improve RD performance. In this paper, we propose a latent diffusion model-based remote sensing image compression (LDM-RSIC) method, which aims to enhance the final decoding quality of RS images by utilizing the generated distortion prior from a LDM. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage I, a self-encoder learns prior from the high-quality input image. In Stage II, the prior is generated through a LDM, conditioned on the decoded image of an existing learning-based image compression algorithm, to be used as auxiliary information for generating the texture-rich enhanced images. To better utilize the prior, a channel attention and gate-based dynamic feature attention module (DFAM) is embedded into a Transformer-based multi-scale enhancement network (MEN) for image enhancement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed LDM-RSIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of both subjective perception and objective metrics.

- **Step I.**  Change the roots of ./ELIC/scripts/test.sh to your data and Use the pretrained models of [ELIC] to generate the initial decoded images.

- **Step II.**  Refer to test_DiffRS2_lambda.yml to set the data roots and pretrained models of [LDM], and run sh ./scriptEn/test.sh Lambada Gpu_ID. Here lambda belongs to [0.0004, 0.0008, 0.0032, 0.01, 0.045] 

```

>>> sh ./ELIC/scripts/test.sh 0.0008 0

>>> sh ./scriptEn/test.sh 0.0008 0
```

## Train
- **Step II.** Learning the compression distortion prior.   
- **Step II.**  Using LDM to generate distortion prior, which is then fed into MEN for improved images.   
```
sh ./scriptEn/trainS1.sh 0.0008 0

sh ./scriptEn/trainS2.sh 0.0008 0
